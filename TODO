* Implement "accept friend request"
Implement friend management (removing friends, adding to friend groups)

* Push posts to friends (working for "all friends" posts)

Implement security (owner can post, see private posts, etc. - public only sees public feed) - partially done. Right now the site itself is not yet secured with a login, since I've been pushing to get a demo done. There will be a separate public home page for partially public plogs
